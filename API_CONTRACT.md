# API Contract — StepSolar Field ↔ StepSolar-CRM

> This same file lives in the separate `StepSolar-CRM` repo. If you change any
> endpoint shape listed below in `server.py`, update it in both places and check
> whether the app needs a matching change before shipping.

This app is a **separate repo** from `StepSolar-CRM` but talks to the same
backend (`stepsolar-backend.onrender.com`). Since there's no shared code
between the two repos, this file is the connection between them — it's
the exact set of endpoints/shapes this app depends on.

**Rule:** if you change any of the request/response shapes below in
`server.py`, update this file in *both* repos in the same sitting, and
check whether the app needs a matching change before you ship the
backend change. If you only add new optional fields, the app keeps
working untouched — just add a line here for the record.

Base URL: `https://stepsolar-backend.onrender.com/api`

| Endpoint | Used for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/login` | Login | body `{email, password}` → `{access_token, id, email, full_name, role, must_change_password}` |
| `GET /auth/me` | Session validation on app reopen | Bearer token → `{id, email, full_name, role}` |
| `GET /crm/leads` | Projects list | App filters on-device by current stage / search / today. `GET /crm/leads/mine` is not required. |
| `GET /crm/leads/{id}` | Project detail | Full lead doc incl. `stages[]`. If 404, app falls back to the list payload. |
| `POST /crm/leads` | New field lead | body CRM lead intake (`full_name`, `phone`, `email`, optional city/state/…) `source` defaults to `Field Agent` |
| `PATCH /crm/leads/{id}` | Stage status/notes/location update | body `{stages: [...]}` — **must send the full stages array**, only the target stage's fields changed, same order/keys as received. Role-based: non-Admin can only change stages where `stage.owner === my role`. |
| `POST /crm/leads/{id}/comments` | Field comment | body `{text}` |
| `POST /crm/leads/{id}/stages/{stage_key}/documents` | Proof photo upload | multipart `file` field. |
| `GET /crm/whatsapp/chat?phone=` | In-app WhatsApp history | Same WaCRM proxy as CRM web. Returns `{messages, contact, conversation_id}`. |
| `POST /crm/whatsapp/chat` | Send WhatsApp text | body `{phone, text}` via WaCRM Business API (not personal `wa.me`). |

## Fields this app adds to the stage object

The backend stores each stage as a free-form dict (only `key` and
`status` are validated), so this app rides an extra field on top without
any backend schema change:

```json
{
  "location": { "lat": 0.0, "lng": 0.0, "accuracy": 0.0, "capturedAt": "iso8601" }
}
```

The CRM web frontend can read this same field to show GPS + notes + photo count per stage.

## Versioning

No formal API version header yet (single backend, single app). If that
ever becomes a problem, add an `X-App-Version` header from the app and
log it server-side before making a breaking change.
